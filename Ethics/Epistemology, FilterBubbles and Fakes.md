## Epistemology:
Is the theory of knowledge, especially the critical study of its validity, methods and scope.

### Proposition:
The factual content expressed by a declarative sentence on a particular occasion and the content of representation mental state (beliefs).

==Different sentences can express the same propositions depending on the context==. Also not every sentence expresses a proposition


### Knowledge:

#### Definition:
- Inventing a new term by assigning a meaning OR
- Using an already existing term and assigning a meaning for a context in which this term was not used yet OR
- using an already existing term and assigning a new meaning in a context where the term is already used, which results in an overloaded term...

#### Explication:
Grasping the agreed meaning of an already existing term by finding necessary and sufficient conditions for it.

>An EXPLICATION might be wrong and inadequate. A DEFINITION just sets a rule and thus cannot be wrong

#### Operationalisation:
Taking a concept and making it measurable by defining some indicators for it that make sense in the context where the operationalisation will be used.

Example: For anonymity

| | |
|-|-|
|Defintion| None, anonymity has been around as a natural term for a long time |
| Explication | multiple approaches | 
| Operationalisation | k-Anonymity in computer science It means that each record in the dataset is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records 


#### Explication of knowledge:
Knowledge is True, Justified and a Belief

##### When is a belief justified?
One explanation can be such that, A belied is said to be justified iff we have other beliefs which jointly support the original belief. This explanation requires all the supporting beliefs to be justified as well.

Now we enter the ==justification trillema==. According to the justification trilemma one of the following is true:
1. There is an infinite regress of justifying beliefs
2. There are beliefs that are justified/unjustified.
	==Fundamentalism==: There are certain fundamental beliefs that need no justification. 
3. The justification is circular
	==Coherentism==: Each belief must be justified by some other belief but this can be circular

## Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles:

### Echo Chamber:
A bounded, enclosed media space that has the potential to both magnify the messages delivered within it and insulate them from rebuttal.

### Filter Bubble:
An echo chamber primarily due to filter algorithms. The filter bubble filters out other opinions facts and evidences such that it seems much more justified to believe in myths.

A filter bubble might 
- hide justification for a truth from us 
- fabricate justifications for falsehoods
- make many coherent falsehoods that they start justifying each other


#### Confirmation Bias:
The tendency to search for, interpret, favour and recall information that confirms or supports ones prior personal belief or values.

## Faked Content:
If we cannot decide whether something is authentic, we cannot use it to justify some belief.

==Scepticism==: Beliefs cannot be justified. Correspondingly, we cannot have knowledge.

If we cannot have first-hand access to something, we might still have beliefs about it on the basis of **testimony**.

In fact many of our beliefs are justified by testimony. But for testimony we need trust. So, as long as we have trustworthy sources, we can still come to justified beliefs.
