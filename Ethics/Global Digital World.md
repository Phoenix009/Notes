### Digital Divide:
Difference in the access, usage and understanding of digital technologies related to 
- low income
- poor literacy skills
- place of residency
- age, etc

Lots of different countermeasures for the different demographic, socio-economical, geographic groups needed


### Data Gaps:
When a particular dataset is unavailable, too sparse, of too low quality or not trustworthy enough.

This is problematic because if we dont know enough about problems that concern a certain group, we cannot effectively mitigate these problems. We might even make things worse


### Job Automation:


### Climate Change:

If the digital sector were a country it would be the fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, accounting for an estimated 3.8% of all emissions.

**Positive effects of tech on environment**:
- AI for more efficiency
	- precision agriculture
	- management of smart grids
	- autonomous vehicles for efficient driving
- For enforcement of green behaviour
- Dematerialisation

#### Rebound Effect:

More Efficiency $\rightarrow$ Save Resources $\rightarrow$ Changes consumer behaviour to become less efficient

##### Direct Rebound Effect:
Increased demand for the good that was saved before

Ex:
Energy Saving Light Bulbs $\rightarrow$ Operating them is cheaper $\rightarrow$ They stay on for an overall longer time.


##### Indirect Rebound Effect:
Increased Demand for other goods

Ex:
Efficient car saves fuel $\rightarrow$ Saves Money $\rightarrow$ Saved money spent on other goods which need energy and resources

### (Philosophical) Reasons for Environmental Protection:

#### Precautionary Principle:
The precautionary principle says that action should be taken to prevent certain great dangers, even if there is scientific uncertainty about the likelihood of the danger. The mere existence of the danger just must be plausible enough.

#### Moral:
*Is nature valuable?*
It is very clear that nature and the environment in general have huge extrinsic value for us, as it is literally our entire basis of existence.

It is morally obligatory to protect the environment


#### Rational:
*It has to be rational to preserve nature, right?*

**Tragedy of commons**: 
A situation in which the use of a resource by everyone spoils the resource.

The tragedy of commons is a problem is deciding that protecting the environment is rational or not.
However, It is still morally right to protect the environment. We are still responsible for the damage we cause


### Responsibility:
Generally speaking, a person or a group of people are morally responsible when their voluntary actions have morally significant outcomes that would make it appropriate to blame or praise them.

- **Backward-Looking Responsibility**:
	Who is to be praised or blamed for something that has happened.
	Ex: Who messed up such that a data leak happened.
	
- **Forward-Looking Responsibility:**
	Who is in a position to make relevant decisions or perform relevant actions such that they might be praised or blamed in the future?
	Ex: How is to make sure that there will not be any data leaks in the future?

There are at least three things that are necessary for A being morally responsible for X:
1. ==Causal Connection==: There is a causal connection between 'A's doing and 'X'.
2. ==Epistemic Access==: 'A' had enough sufficiently well justified beliefs about the possible consequences of their doing that lead to 'X'
3. ==Control==: 'A' had/was able to have some control over their doing that lead to 'X'

Problems:
1. Causal Connection:
	1. Problem of Many Hands:
		- Epistemic: It is difficult to trace the error back and determine who was responsible for what when multiple contributed to the outcome
		- Metaphysics: Many people involved so the responsibility dilutes and cannot be assigned to anyone.
		  
2. Epistemic Access:
	1. Computer scientists just cannot predict the consequences of their actions:
		-  Matters can be very complicated
		- Some systems are very opaque
		- Developing fast and enabling us to do thing we were not able to do before.
		  
3. Control:
	- We can make decision making automated, now we cannot control what the automated decision is
	- Some designs are to make the users exhibit certain behaviour
