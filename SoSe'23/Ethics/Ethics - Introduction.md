Do precise thinking. Very important for structuring your arguments for what is ethical and what is not.


### Ethics:
1. *Meta Ethics* - Concerned with the nature of moral properties, statements and judgements. Ex: What is the meaning of "right" or "good"?
2. *Normative Ethics* - The study of moral actions. Ex: What properties make an action morally right?
3. *Applied Ethics* - Concerned with the moral status of certain practices or issues. Ex: Has Snowden done the right thing? Is it wrong to eat mea from intensive animal farming?

The focus of normative ethics is to find a theory that is accurate regardless of how useful it is in the real life. Whereas, applied ethics cares about both being accurate and being able to be applied in real life scenarios.

### Vocabulary:
1. Deontic and Evaluative

2. Agents, Actions and Consequences
	An *agent* performs an *act* and has *consequences*
	
	An agent decides on an action and performs it. This may affect patients. Moral subjects and objects are what has moral status.
	
	Moral Patients: *"The question is not, can they reason? Can they talk? but, can they suffer?"*

3. Decision Situations:
	1. Objective: An agent has options for choosing an action and ==knows what are their consequences==.

	2. Subjective under certainty: An agent has options for choosing an action and knows ==what are their consequences==.

	3. Subjective under risk: An agent has options for action and each action has multiple consequences with a ==known probability==

	4. Subjective under uncertainty: An agent has options for action and each action has multiple consequences with an ==unknown probability==

### What is right?

1. Focusing on the ==Agent==: Virtue Theories
2. Focusing on the ==Action==: Deontological theories
3. Focusing on the ==Consequence==: Consequentialist theories

#### Focusing on Consequences: Consequentialism:

##### Framework
The moral/deontic status of an action solely depends on its consequences (and the consequences of the alternative actions).

Agent A ought to perform one of the right actions.

An action $\phi$ is a right action iff the ==relevant qualities== of the ==consequences== of $\phi$ fulfil a ==specific condition==.

##### Which Qualities?
Depends on the *Axiology*.

**Axiology**: 

A theory about what has value or disvalue, especially about what has intrinsic value or disvalue.

1. *Hedonism*: 
	intrinsic value: pleasure
	intrinsic disvalue: pain
	intuition: How good/bad is someone feeling?
	
2. *Preference Theory*:
	intrinsic value: preference satisfaction
	intrinsic disvalue: preference frustration
	intuition: How well are someones wishes, desires etc. fulfilled?

3. *Objective List Accounts*:
	intuition: How much objective goods from the list does someone have and to what extent?


So to answer the question of which qualities? We calculate the utility based on the axiology used.

For hedonism the utility is the net pleasure gained, for preference theory is the net amount of preferences satisfied.


##### Which Consequences?
1. Subjective Accounts:
	Only the ==consequences that have to be expected by the agent== have to be taken into account.
2. Objective Accounts:
	only the consequences that will or would actually obtain have to be taken into account.


##### Which Condition?
1. *Maximization*: Maximize the overall sum of utility.
2. Equalization: Distribute utility as equally as possible.
3. *Satisficing*: Raise the overall sum utility above a certain threshold.
4. *Individual Satisficing*: Raise the individual utility above a certain threshold.


Now we have the entire framework setup for determining the moral status of an action in consequentialism.

Consider utilitarianism:
	which qualities? Hedonism
	which consequences? subjective
	which condition? maximization

The actions is right iff no alternative action has a higher sum of pleasure - pain.

Misnomer: *Rule Consequentialism*: 
An action is right iff it ==adheres to a right set of rules==. A set of rules is right iff the general adherence to these rules has consequences, where the relevant qualities of these consequences fulfil a specific condition.

Misconception: Every action can be justified with consequentialism.
"The end justifies the means" does not mean the same as "Every means is always justified".


##### Objections to Consequentialism:
1. *Nearest Dearest Objection*:
	Everybodys utility counts the same, so you must not benefit those near and dear to you, if you can generate more overall utility by benefitting strangers.
	Ex: Giving flowers to someone you dont like instead of your mum, because they would be much more happy.

2. *Collective Action Problem*:
	If you cannot make a difference, anything is possible.
	Ex: Flights to Hawaii

3. *The Colosseum Case*:
	Ex: The Gladiators in ancient Rome.
	Some mild amusement of many is enough to justify some immense and non consensual suffering of a few as long as the crown is big enough.

4. *Lost Integrity Problem*:
	Consequentialism can demand you to violate your integrity.
	Ex: A pacifist taking up a weapons manufacturing job against his will to minimize the harm.

5. *Over Demanding Objection*:
	Ex: Jumping of the bridge to stop the train from running over people.


#### Focusing on Act: Deontological Theories:

The moral status of an action solely depends on its adherence to a rule or a set of rules.

##### Framework:
An action is right iff it adheres to certain universal rules

##### Which Rules?

###### 1. *Kantianism - Categorical Imperative*:
==An action is right iff it is motivated by moral duty==

*How do we know if someone is motivated?*

There are two possibilities.
1. Acting merely in accordance with duty
	Ex: A merchant being honest with his customers becuase they might come back again, thus making him profits.
	
2. Acting from the motive of duty
	Ex: A merchant being honest with his customers becuase this is what moral duty demands.

What is moral duty? - ==Categorical Imperative==

Duties can be of two types.
1. Perfect Duties
	No latitude in how we want to fulfil them.
	Must never be violated.
	
2. ImPerfect Duties:
	Some latitude in how we want to fulfil them.
	Overall need to be fulfilled, but if sometimes acted against them for good reasons is also okay.


***Formula of Universality***
"Act only according to a maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should be a universal law"

![Formula-of-Universality](file:///Users/phoenix/Downloads/kantinism_universality.jpg)



***Formula of Humanity***
You are allowed to treat others as a ==means==(to get what you want), as long as you also treat them as an ==end==(in a way that is truly good for them).

![Formula-of-Humanity](file:///Users/phoenix/Downloads/kantinism_humanity.jpg)


***Criticism of Kant's Moral Philosphy***
1. *General clarity and understandability*
	If a theory is too unclear, it cannot properly serve as either a criterion of righteousness or a decision procedure.

2. *Problem of formulating the maxime*
	Maximes are an important parts of Kants theory. But what is the maxime of an action?

3. *Highly Counterintuitive results*


###### 2. *Conctractualism - Contractualistic Rules*:

Everybody ought to act upon principles which would be reasonable in a universal contract.

***Scanlons Contractualism***:

"==An act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any sets of principles for the general regulation of behaviour that no one could reasonably, reject as a basis for informed, unforced, general agreement=="

What is informed, unforced and general agreement?
- *Informed*: everyone knows and understands all principles in the set
- *Unforced*: nobody is forced by anything other than their reason to accept a set of principles.
- *General*: if a set were agreed upon, everybody would always follow all the principles in this set.

When can someone reasonably reject?
- If it imposes a burden on me
- If my rejection does not impose a much greter burden on someone else
- If the set distributes the burden in a way that is unacceptable

![Scanlorns-Contractualism](file:///Users/phoenix/Downloads/scanlons-contractualism%20(1).jpg)


***Problems for Scanlons Contractualism***:
1. *Basically just Consequentialism*: Not really as here we are concerned about the set of principles that have no role in consequentialism
2. *Ignores animals and future people*: What if something affects individuals who cannot reasonably reject?
3. *Dictatorship of the one who is worst off*: We always give priority to the one with the greatest burden, regardless of how many other are affected.


#### Focusing on Agent: Virtue Ethics:

##### What is a virtue?
==A virtue is an excellent trait of character==. Well entrenched in its possessor - to notice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act and react in certain characteristic way.

In many classical conceptions, virtues are associated with a balance between two vices.
$$ \text{Vice (Too little): Cowardice < Virtue: Courage < Vice (Too much): Rashness}$$


##### Virtue Ethics - Rough Idea:
- *Rough Idea 1 - Eudamonism*:
	An action is right in a given context if a virtuous person would do the act in the same context.
	Problem: Allows doing the right thing out of wring motives.
	
- *Rough Idea 2*:
	An action is right only if action expresses a virtue.

==Virtue ethics might be a nice criterion of rightness but is hard to apply to complex situations in professional contexts.==



### Normative Domains:

==Normative==: Concerning how something should be, how someone should behave etc.

Ex:
"should" can have a lot more than one meaning

| Scenario | Domain |
|:--------:|:------:|
|You should donate to charity    | Moral             |
|You should pay your taxes       | Law               |
| You should not put ice in beer | Social convention |

When analysing an action we must also consider in which normative domain we are asked to do the action. It is possible that the action is permissible in one domain but not in other. In this way the domains conflict.


### Morals and Laws:
Ideally: Morals should justify the laws. However, there is not complete overlap between the actions that are permissible by law and those permissible by morals.

Ex:

|Actions                           | Example|
|----------------------------------|--------|
|permitted by morals but not by law| Assassinating a tyrant. |
| permitted by both morals and law | rescuing someone from drowning|
|permitted by law but not by morals| Lying to your grandma |


*Why does law need to be justified?*
Anything can be made a law but not everything should be a law

*For what do we then need law?*
Law helps prevent people from doing actions that are morally incorrect.

*Can good laws substitute morals?*
No because not everything that is morally right or wrong should be regulated by law. I dont want to go to jail for telling a small lie to my grandma


==!!! Using the law as a reason to justify an action is not OK.==
If we allow using law to justify actions then what nazis did was right as it was according to the law.


### Code of Ethics:
Normative ethics is done by experts who have spend their lifetime researching. Computer scientists are supposed to come to a morally right decision in a short time. Alone in small groups of non-experts.

Code of Ethics are a set of rules and principles for professionals.
Organisations and associations hire philosophers and other experts that can formulate a code of ethics that other professionals can follow to make ethically right decisions.
