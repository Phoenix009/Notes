THE ATTENTION ECONOMY:
Business view ==human attention as a scarce, yet desirable resource== and make it one of their primary ==objectives to design their products to get as much human attention as possible==

We don't know the precise psychological mechanisms behind many technologies and designs that capture our attention. Mechanisms made using A/B testing.

Examples of mechanisms used:
1. Intermittent Variable Rewards
2. Design taking advantage of our desired for social validation
3. Designs that erode natural stopping cues

**Paternalism**:
Paternalism is the interference of a state or an individual with another person, against their will, and defended or motivated by a claim that the person interfered with will be better off or protected from harm.

|Paternalistic Use of nudging | Consensual use of nudging|
|-|-|
| without my knowledge or against my will | with my knowledge according to my will|
Both encourage a change of behaviour maybe in a way that is beneficial

# Autonomy and Free Will

## What is autonomy?
An agent is autonomous iff she governs her own action

When does an agent govern its own view?
1. Coherentist view:
	An agent governs her own action if and only if she is motivated to act as she does because this motivation coheres with some mental state that represents her point of view on the action.

2. Reasons-Responsiveness View
	An agent governs her own actions only if her motives, or the mental processes that produce them, are responsive to a sufficiently wide range of reasons for and against behaving as she does.

3. Incompatibilist View
	An agent governs her own actions only if her actions cannot be fully explained as the effects of causal powers that are independent of her, even if her beliefs and attitudes are among these effects.
