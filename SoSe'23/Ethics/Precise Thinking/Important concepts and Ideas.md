- **Argument**:
	- A collection of statements of which at least one functions as a ==conclusion== and the remainder as ==premises==. 
	- The premises are intended to support the conclusion

- **Validity**:
	- An argument is valid iff it is not possible for all premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.

- **Soundness**:
	- An argument is sound iff it is valid and all its premises are true.

- **Rhetoric**:
	- Rhetoric is an attempt to persuade mostly through the power of words not through reason.

-  **Principle of Charity**:
	- While reading:
		- Find the best and strongest interpretation of any text
		- Assume that every text was written by someone rational, capable and intelligent.
	- While writing:
		- Write as precise as if our addressee does not read using principle of charity.
		- Write as easy and crisp as possible 

-  **Defeasible Force**:
	- An argument is defeasibly forceful iff it is not deductively valid, but given the premises and only the premises, it is sufficiently probable that the conclusion is true

- **Defeasible cogency**:
	- An argument is defeasibly cogent iff it is defeasibly forceful and all the premises are true

-  **Presupposition**:
	- A statement presupposes $p$ iff in order to properly make sense of the statement you have to assume $p$

-  **Rational Persuasiveness**:
	- an argument is rationally persuasive to someone iff it is epistemically rational for them to be persuaded by the conclusion given by the argument

- **Digital Divide**: 
	- Difference in the access, usage and understanding of digital technologies related to low income, poor literacy skills, place of residency, age, etc

- **Data Gaps**:
	- When a particular dataset is unavailable, too sparse, of too low quality or not trustworthy enough.

- **Rebound Effect**:
	- More Efficiency $\rightarrow$ Save Resources $\rightarrow$ Changes consumer behaviour to become less efficient
	- **Direct Rebound Effect**:
		- Increased demand for the good that was saved before
		- Ex: Energy Saving Light Bulbs $\rightarrow$ Operating them is cheaper $\rightarrow$ They stay on for an overall longer time.
	- **Indirect Rebound Effect**:
		- Increased Demand for other goods
		- Ex: Efficient car saves fuel $\rightarrow$ Saves Money $\rightarrow$ Saved money spent on other goods which need energy and resources

- **Tragedy of Commons**:
	- A situation in which the use of a resource by everyone spoils the resource. 
	- Ex: Everyone grazes their cattle on a single pasture that destroys that pasture.

- **Responsibility**:
	- There are at least three things that are necessary for A being morally responsible for X:
	1. ==Causal Connection==: There is a causal connection between 'A's doing and 'X'.
	2. ==Epistemic Access==: 'A' had enough sufficiently well justified beliefs about the possible consequences of their doing that lead to 'X'
	3. ==Control==: 'A' had/was able to have some control over their doing that lead to 'X'
