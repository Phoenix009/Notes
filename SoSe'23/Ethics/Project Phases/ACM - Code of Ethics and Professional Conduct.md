The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the computing profession.

The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration.

The Code as a whole is concerned with how fundamental ethical principles apply to a computing professionals conduct. It servers as a basis for ethical decision making.



### General Ethical Principles:

#### 1. Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing:
Minimize negative consequences including threats to health, safety, personal security and privacy.

Computing professionals should consider whether the results of their efforts will:
- respect diversity
- be used in socially responsible ways
- meet social needs
- broadly accessible


#### 2. Avoid Harm:
Harm here means negative consequences, especially when those are significant and unjustified.

Avoiding harm begins with careful consideration of potential impacts of all those affected by decisions. When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified.


#### 3. Be honest and trustworthy:
A computing professional should be transparent and provide full disclosure of all pertinent system capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties.


#### 4. Be fair and take action not to discriminate:
The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and justice govern this principle.

Harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying, and ==other abuses of power and authority==, is a form of discrimination that, amongst other harms, limits fair access to the virtual and physical spaces where such harassment takes place.

Technologies and practices should be as inclusive and accessible as possible and computing professionals should take action to avoid creating systems or technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people. Failure to design for ==inclusiveness and accessibility may constitute unfair discrimination==.


#### 5. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts:
Computing professionals should credit the creators of ideas, inventions, work, and artifacts, and ==respect copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, and other methods of protecting authors' works==.


#### 6. Respect Privacy:
A computing professional should be conversant in various definitions and forms of privacy and should ==understand the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information==.

This requires taking precautions to prevent re-identification of anonymized data or unauthorized data collection, ensuring the accuracy of data, understanding the provenance of the data, and protecting it from unauthorized access and accidental disclosure.

Only the minimum amount of personal information necessary should be collected in a system. ==The retention and disposal periods for that information should be clearly defined, enforced, and communicated to data subjects==.

#### 7. Honor Confidentiality:

### Professional Responsibilities:

#### 1. Strive to acheive high quality in both the process and products of professional work:

#### 2. Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct and ethical practice:

#### 3. Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work:
Rules here include local, regional, national and international laws and regulations, as well as any policies and procedures of the organizations to which the professional belongs.

A rule may be untethicaL when it has an inadequate moral basis or causes recognizable harm.


#### 4. Accept and provide appropriate professional review:

#### 5. Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks:
