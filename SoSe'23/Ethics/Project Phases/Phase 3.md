### 1.
#### 4. Be fair and take action not to discriminate:
"Failure to design forÂ inclusiveness and accessibility may constitute unfair discrimination"

Not all groups of users have access to the 


#### 6. Respect Privacy:
"The retention and disposal periods for that information should be clearly defined, enforced, and communicated to data subjects"

This information is not communicated to the users.


### 2.
##### a. *Preference theoretic, maximising, subjective utilitarianism*:
==Agent specific preferences==:
1. Juan: Would like to have visually impaired users for his application. Would not want to lower his standard of living

2. Free Lance Developer: Have employment. Work on meaningful tasks that have impact

3. Current User base: Have no preference for the implementation of feature however, 5% would benefit from the feature

4. Visually impaired users: No preference, yet few would enjoy using the application

==CONCLUSION==: It is morally correct to implement the feature as the overall utility is maximised.


##### b. *Scanlons Contractualism*:
==Principle==: We assume there is a principle that allows us to not implement a feature in order to save costs.

==Burdens by imposing the principle==:
According to us it should not pose any burden on anyone.

==Burdens by rejecting the principle==:
Places minimal burden on the application owners as it costs them money but does not affect them or their families standard of living.

==CONCLUSION==:
Juan should not implement the feature as there is a burden on the him if he does implement the feature.


##### c. *Kantinism - Formula of Humanity*:
==Means==:
- Freelance Developer: Will actually be implementing the feature
- Juan: Will spend money in order to get the feature implemented

==Ends==:
- Freelance Developer: Will get money and content of having implemented a feature having significant impact.

==CONCLUSION==:
Juan is used as a means and is not an "end" of the action. Thus, we do not implement the feature


##### d. *Kantinism - Formula of Universality*:
==Maxim M==: In order to save costs one does not implement a feature.

==Universal Law L==: Nobody implements a feature in order to save costs.

==Is M consistently conceivable==: YES, it is possible for everyone to not implement a feature if it costs them money.

==Can we rationally live in such a world==: NO. We as users will not get useful features that help us in our day to day life. 

==CONCLUSION==:
Hence, We usually should not implement the feature to save costs.
