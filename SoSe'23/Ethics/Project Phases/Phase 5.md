Argument: Argument A

P1:  It has to be expected that heartbreak, catfishing, or other dangers associated with online dating will lead to serious harm for at least some people who use online dating apps.

P2:  2ofHearts is an online dating app.

P3:  If P1 and P2, then it has to be expected that at least some people will be seriously harmed as a result of 2ofHearts.

P4:  If it has to be expected that at least some people will be seriously harmed as a result of 2ofHearts, then Ace morally should put a complete stop to 2ofHearts and remove it from all app stores.

C: Ace morally should put a complete stop to 2ofHearts and remove it from all app stores.




### Argument 1:

#### Q1

Heartbreak, deceit, and disappointment are inherent risks in relationships, whether formed online or offline. However, removing online dating apps from all app stores is not a productive solution. 

Platforms like 2OfHearts understand these risks and actively provide resources and support for users who may encounter adverse outcomes. Acknowledging that many successful and meaningful relationships have been built through online dating apps is essential. Eliminating these platforms would deny users the opportunity to connect and find happiness. 

Instead of removal, the focus should be on implementing adequate safety measures, promoting awareness, and empowering users to make informed decisions while engaging in online dating. By addressing the challenges and enhancing user safety, we can ensure that online dating remains viable for those seeking companionship and love.

  
  

#### Q2

P1: Completely shutting down 2ofHearts and removing it from all app stores is a drastic measure.

P2: Drastic measures should only be taken when no other viable alternatives exist to address the potential harm.

P3: Alternative measures can be implemented to mitigate the potential harm associated with 2ofHearts.

C: Ace should implement alternative measures rather than completely shutting down 2ofHearts

  
#### Q3

Even if shutting down 2ofHearts entirely and removing it from all app stores seems severe, there are some cases when taking such measures to address possible harm effectively may be necessary.

Alternative solutions might not be as successful as a total shutdown in fostering a safer online dating environment. There is no assurance that particular measures will be faultless or that users will constantly abide by the advised standards, even if they are implemented. Ace would take decisive action to eliminate the potential hazards and safeguard consumers from any harm related to the app by shutting down 2ofHearts.

In conclusion, while alternative measures should be considered and implemented where appropriate, there are situations where a complete shutdown and removal from app stores are justified.
