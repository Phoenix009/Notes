### Accessibility:
The cost of technology is an accessibility concern associated with smartwatches. 2OfHearts depends heavily on the data collected from smartwatches for finding matches and thus also inherits accessibility concerns associated with smartwatches. 

It is crucial to prioritise accessibility in technology design to ensure that everyone can participate in digital spaces on an equal footing. Accommodating users having no access to smartwatches or other required hardware is a crucial step towards ensuring inclusivity and addressing the accessibility concerns.

2OfHearts should not provide any disadvantage to users who do not have access to smart watches. By modifying the algorithm to be more inclusive and adaptable to users without smartwatches, the application can foster a more inclusive and accessible matchmaking experience. It allows users from various backgrounds and economic circumstances to participate on an equal footing, reducing frustration and ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to find compatible matches.

  

### Optimise the algorithm:
The 2ofHearts documentation goes into great detail on how the app uses biometric data from smartwatches. However, it is not documented how the algorithm behaves when such data is not available. We therefore assume that no special measures are taken to optimise accuracy in this case, for example by asking the user about their current emotional state instead of inferring it from biometric data. 

The matchmaking algorithm may not be optimised to handle such users and may assign them fewer matches, potentially causing them to be force-matched more often. Even if enough matches are made, they may not be aligned as closely to the user’s preferences. This may cause frustration, as the user may feel unattractive or unwanted. 

Therefore, steps should be taken to let such users without a smartwatch, use 2ofHearts effectively. The matchmaking algorithm should not put them at a disadvantage compared to users with access to a smartwatch, assigning them a comparable amount of matches. Although some imprecision cannot be prevented when smartwatch data is missing, the matches should align with the user’s preferences as closely as possible. This is essential for creating an inclusive and accessible matchmaking experience.  Therefore, the algorithm should be optimised for working with limited data.

### Providing Premium Features:
To ensure a fair and inclusive dating environment, 2OfHearts must exercise caution when providing advanced search filters as a paid premium feature. There is no details provided on what these filters will be based upon. 

Certain search filters which may allow users to filter potential matches based on specific criteria such as race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status should be prohibited. Such filters can lead to discriminatory behaviour and reinforce biases. It can encourage a superficial approach to dating, prioritising physical appearance or specific traits rather than fostering genuine connections based on shared values, interests, and personalities.

To address these ethical concerns, ACE should carefully consider the impact of advanced search filters on user behaviour, inclusivity, and fairness. It is essential to strike a balance between personal preferences and fostering a dating environment that values diversity, respect, and inclusivity.
