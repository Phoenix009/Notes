- How are immutable variables different from constants?
	- you aren’t allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable
	- declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value _must_ be annotated
	- constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

- How is shadowing different from reassignment of a `mut` variable?
	- Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
	- The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.

- Why does `let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };` not compile?
	- the type of the variable should be inferred at the compile time. Here the outcome of the condition is unknown and we cannot infer if the type of the variable `number` is a `usize` or a `&str`. We want our if-expressions to return the same type at all possible blocks.
