# Primes and Divisibility

- Set of integers is denoted as $\mathbb{Z}$
- for $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, 
	- a divides b is denoted as $a \mid b$
	- a does no divides b is denoted as $a \nmid b$
- if $a \mid b$ then
	- $a$ is a divisor of $b$
	- if $a \notin {1, b}$ then $a$ is a non trivial divisor or a factor of $b$
- a positive integer $p \gt 1$ is prime if it has not factors.
- the greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$ is denoted as $gcd(a, b)$ and is the largest $c$ such that $c \mid a$ and $c \mid b$
- if $p$ is prime then $gcd(a, p) = 1 \text{ or } p$ 
- if $gcd(a, b) = 1$ then $a, b$ are said to be co-prime
