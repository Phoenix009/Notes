# 1. Runtime Parameters

## Implementation
- We take input from the users via command line and assign it to some global configuration variables.
- Where the behaviour is dependent on these configurations we have appropriate code to modify the behaviour based on the passed configurations

### Propagating Parameters:
- If we dont want a global variable for the configuration then the config variables need to be passed through many calls.

### How are configuration specified:
- Command line
- Config file
- Dialog
- Source code
- Registry

## Presence Conditions and Taints
Taint Analysis done to understand which part of code is dependent on which configuration variables.

Taints = $(w, v, c)$
- $w$ - variable
- $v$ - value of the variable
- $c$ - constraint on the variable

## Advantages:
- Simple implementation, no extra technologies or tools needed.

## Disadvantages:
- Feature code scattered across the entire program
- Global variables or bloated parameter lists
- Unclear which code belongs to which feature
- No generator is used -> Always all feature delivered
	- Code size, memory consumption, performance
	- Unused features pose a security risk

## Feature Modularity

### Prospects of Modularity
- Enables modular reasoning
- Reduces complexity (Divide and Conquer)
- Reuse and compose pieces


### Measuring Cohesion and Coupling:
#### Basic Definitions

| | |
|-|-|
|$\text{intdeps}(f)$|Set of dependencies among program elements of feature $f$|
|$\text{extdeps}(f)$| Set of dependencies among program elements of feature $f$ with elements from other features|
|$\text{elements}(f)$| Set of program elements of feature $f$|

$$\text{IFD} = \frac{|\text{intdeps}(f)|}{|\text{elements}(f)| \cdot (|\text{elements}(f)|-1) / 2}$$
$$\text{EFD} = \frac{|\text{extdeps}(f)|}{|\text{intdeps}(f) \cup \text{extdeps}(f)|}$$

## Runtime Parameters are anti-modular

**Scattered Code**:
	Code belonging to a single feature is scattered across multiple modules.

**Tangled Code**:
	Code belonging to different features is intermixed in a single modules

**Crosscutting Feature**:
	feature whose code is scattered and tangled

**Problems of Crosscutting features**:
- Features tend to vanish in the codebase.
- difficult division of work.
- Lower productivity, Difficult evolution.

| | |
|-|-|
|$\text{M}$|Set of modules of a program|
|$\text{locations}(f)$| Set of code locations of feature $f$|
|$\text{locations}(m)$| Set of code locations of module  $m$|

**Feature Scattering Degree**:
$$SD(f) = |\{m \mid \text{locations}(f) \cap \text{locations}(m) \ne \emptyset \}|$$

**Module Tangling Degree**:
$$TD(m) = |\{f \mid \text{locations}(f) \cap \text{locations}(m) \neq \emptyset \}|$$

# 2. Design Patterns
Design patterns are descriptions of collaborating objects and classes that are customised to solve a general design problem in particular context.

We will discuss a few patterns that are well suited for variability implementations.

## Observer Pattern
- The observer pattern describes a common way to implement distributed event handling, in which a subject notifies all registered observers of change to its state. 
- In product-line development, the observer pattern makes it easy to add and remove features, provided that a feature can be implemented as an observer.
- ==Variability is achieved by registering or not registering observers.==

## Template Method Pattern
- The template-method pattern defines a skeleton of an algorithm in an abstract class, but leaves certain steps of the algorithm to be specified by a subclass.
- Different subclasses can provide different implementations of these steps by overriding one or multiple methods, and can thus influence program behavior.
- In product-line development, we can exploit this pattern and implement behavior of alternative features by means of different subclasses. 
- Especially, if the algorithm differs only in minor details in each feature, we can share the common parts of the algorithm in a common abstract class.
- ==The template-method pattern is best suited for alternative features that is, when only one feature out of a set of features can be selected at a time.==
- ==However, template method is not suitable for combining multiple features, due to limitations of inheritance==

## Strategy Pattern
- The strategy pattern aims at variability in algorithms. the strategy pattern uses delegation instead of inheritance.
- the strategy pattern consists of three roles
	- context: implements the main algorithm
	- strategy interface: describes the functionality that can be provided by the clients
	- concrete implementations of the strategy
- A strategy is passed to the context in some form.
- ==Using the strategy pattern, a client can select which implementation of the strategy should be used during the execution.==
- Combining multiple features is possible.
- This pattern encourages encapsulation and decoupling of features, and even enables distributed development and separate compilation.

## Decorator Pattern
- The decorator pattern describes a delegation-based mechanism to flexibly extend objects with additional behaviour
- The strength of decorators is that additional behaviour can be added incrementally at run time to existing classes
- In product-line development, the decorator pattern is well-suited to implement optional features and feature groups of which multiple features can be selected.

## Summary design patterns.
Similar to runtime-parameters, but with the following distinctions.

## Strong points:
- Well established, ease communication between developers.
- Guidelines for disciplined design.
- Separate feature code from base code, possibly with clear interfaces.
- Noninvasive extensions without modifying the base code, given a preplanning effort. 

## Weak points:
- Boilerplate code and architectural overhead.
- Preplanning of extension points necessary.



# 3. Frameworks:
- A framework is an incomplete set of collaborating classes that can be extended and tailored for a specific use case.
- A framework provides explicit points for extensions, called hot spots, at which developers can extend the framework.
- a framework is responsible for the main control flow and asks its extensions for custom behaviour, on demand; a principle called inversion of control.
- In feature-oriented product-line development, ideally, we develop one plug-in per feature and configure the application by assembling and activating plug-ins corresponding to the feature selection â€” a composition process.

## White Box Frameworks:
- White-box frameworks consist of a set of concrete and abstract classes. To customize their behavior, developers extend white-box frameworks by overriding and adding methods through **subclassing**.
- All non-private fields and methods can be regarded as hotspots of the framework, providing additional flexibility.

## Black Box Frameworks:
- Black-box frameworks separate framework code and extensions through interfaces.
- A plug-in extends hot spots of a black-box framework with custom behavior. A plug-in can be separately compiled and deployed. 
- Whereas white-box frameworks can be understood in terms of the template-method pattern, black-box frameworks follow the strategy and observer patterns
- The framework exposes explicit hot spots, at which plug-ins can register observers and strategies.
