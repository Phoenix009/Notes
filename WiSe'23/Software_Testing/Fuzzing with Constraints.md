In the previous chapters we have seen how Grammar Based Fuzzing allows us to efficiently generate syntactically valid inputs.

However, there are semantic features that cannot be expressed in a context-free grammar.

Now we will see how ISLa framework allows us to express such semantic features as constraints to a grammar.

# Summary:
- ISLa specification language allows to add constraints to a grammar
- ISLa Solver solves these constraints to produce semantically valid inputs
- OSLa checker checks given inputs for whether they satisfy these constraints.
