Sometimes, we need to convert our customer base from existing service to a new replacement service.

Whatever the reason, converting customers from one service to another is a task that SAs often face.

Our goal should be for the conversions to go smoothly and be completely invisible to our customers.

to approach this goal, we need to plan the project very carefully.
This chapter describes some of these areas to consider in that planning process.

We need to plan every step of a conversion well in advance to pull it off successfully with minimum impact on your customers. This chapter should shape our thinking in that planning process.

# Minimising Intrusiveness:
If we cannot minimise intrusiveness, at least we can make the intrusion fast and well organised.

# Layers v/s Pillars:
A conversion project like any project is divided into discrete tasks, some of which have to be performed for every customer.

As part of the project planning for conversion we need to decide whether to perform these tasks in layers or in pillars:

With layers approach we perform one task for all the customers before moving on to the next task and doing that for all the customers

With the pillars approach, we perform all the required tasks for each customer at once, before moving into the next customer.

Tasks that are intrusive to the customer, can be safely performed in layers. However, tasks that are intrusive for a customer should be performed in pillars.


# Vendor Support:

# Communication:
Indeed, communicating a conversion far in advance is critical.

Any customers who use the system extensively should be involved early in the project to make sure that their needs will be met.

# Training:
If any aspect of the user experience is going to change, training should be provided.

Most changes are small and can be brought to peopleâ€™s attention via email. However, for roll-outs of large, new systems, training is critical to the success of their introduction to an organisation.

# Gradual Roll outs:

# Flash Cuts:

# Instant Rollback:

# Decision Point:
